    "In this notebook, we perform image recognition on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains a collection of handwritten digits. It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. There are 70,000 images. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and each feature simply represents one pixel’s intensity, from 0 (white) to 255 (black). Hence each image in the set has 784 features."
